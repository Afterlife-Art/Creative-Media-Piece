														<h6>Rasheed is drawn with droopy face features, a hooked nose, a double chin, a low hairline, and overgrown hairs growing out of his chest.</h6>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">This illustration of Rasheed is accurate as he is described with “features [that] seem broad and droopy” (Hosseini 123). He also has a “big, square, ruddy face; [a] hooked nose; …. [an] impossibly low hairline, [with a] wall of thick, coarse, salt and pepper hair” (Hosseini 36).</li>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">The outgrown chest hairs and weight depict how Rasheed is careless about his personal health and hygiene, which is not only an indicator of how he treats himself, but an indicator of how he treats those around him, he treats them carelessly.</li>
																</ul>
															</ul>
														</p>
														<h6>Mariam is drawn with cuts and bruises on her face, with a long face, narrow set eyes, a spotty face, archless eyebrows, and a sharp chin.</h6>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">This illustration of Mariam represents how she is abused in her relationship with Rasheed due to many factors including what is acceptable for a man in society. This is clear when Rasheed sexually assaults Mariam and justifies his actions by saying “There is no shame in this, Mariam, … It’s what married people do. It’s what the Prophet himself and his wives did There is no shame” (Hosseini 51)</li>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">He abuses Mariam regularly, and an example of this is when Rasheed has to eat undercooked rice and to get his revenge on Mariam, he makes her eat pebbles, “leaving Mariam to spit out pebbles, blood, and the fragments of two broken molars” (Hosseini 67).</li>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">Mariam is drawn with these specific features as this is how Mariam views herself when looking into the mirror before marrying Rasheed.</li>
																</ul>
															</ul>
														</p>
														<h6>Addition Symbolism:</h6>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">Rasheed being drawn bigger than Mariam represents the power imbalance between the two where Rasheed holds the greater power. My illustration symbolizes this imbalance by not only making Rasheed bigger than Mariam but also shadowing her with darkness just as he did throughout the novel.</li>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">His strong grip on her is indicative of the control he had over Mariam no matter the situation. From losing her right to choose her life partner to losing her right to voice her opinion or objection Rasheed was in full control of Mariam’s life and from the many instances which exemplified Rasheeds male dominance one example is when Mariam says, “I… I don’t want this,” Mariam said numb with contempt and helplessness. In reply, Rasheed said “It’s notyour decision. It’s hers and mine.”(Hosseini 92)</li>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">Rasheed and Mariam being in the foreground of the art piece where it is dark compared to the background where there is immense colour is also a symbolic representation of how Rasheed has always held Mariam back from the “light” (joy) she could have indulged in her whole life. My illustration visualizes how he kept her forcefully in the darkness of life with himself by holding her rather than allowing her to be free and experience a joyous life represented by the colourful background.</li>

														<p>The rock wall in the foreground represents how despite where Mariam went, as long as Rasheed was in her life, she will be living a life behind a wall, unable to act of her own free will. This barrier in Mariam's life was made evident by Rasheed from the beginning of his and Mariam's marraige, when he exclaimed:</p>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<li style="margin-left: 40px">“I’m [Rasheed] a different breed of man, Mariam. Where I come from, one wrong look, one improper word, and blood is spilled. Where I come from, a woman’s face is her husband’s business only. I want you to remember that. Do you understand?” (Hosseini 70)</li>
															</ul>
														</p>
														<p>Rasheed feels that he is a different breed of man than the "progressive" Afghan husbands who let their women parade around the streets of Kabul uncovered. According to Rasheed this "new breed" of man takes ownership of their women treating them more like a pet than a human being. Which I have visually symbolized in my creative media piece through this stone wall placed in front of Mariam which strips her of all rights and identity.</p>

														<p>The presence of male dominance and misogyny throughout “A Thousand Splendid Suns” cannot be overlooked. Laila and Mariam live through a rough period for women's rights in Afghanistan where women are inferior to men. They're controlled by the government, treated as property by their husbands, and forbidden from taking part in society.</p>
														<p>Mariam feels as if Rasheed treats her like a "house cat" after she is unable to produce a child, and Laila's status is reduced when she gives birth to a girl. The only person in Rasheed's home that is treated well is Zalmai because he is a boy. In addition, the only way that women can escape abusive marriages is if they have a willing male chaperone to help them escape.</p>
														<p>Later in the novel at the climax when Mariam explains why she killed Rasheed, and the only witness is a woman, Laila, it is as if there are no witnesses. The judge will not accept the testimony of a woman and says, “God has made us differently, you women and us men. Our brains are different. You are not able to think like we can. Western doctors and their science have proven this. This is why we require only one male witness but two female ones.” (Hosseini 365) Mariam goes to her death because of this widely accepted idea that women as a group are shameful creatures who must be kept in check by men.</p>
														<p>Therefore my torn apart women’s rights symbol buried into the ground accurately symbolizes the harsh lack of women’s rights throughout the novel which is a big factor in Mariam’s life story. While representing my in-depth knowledge of the novel's themes and characters.</p>

														<p>The characters of “A Thousand Splendid Suns” are wounded in wars, stuck in abusive relationships, and rejected by their families leaving them to struggle every day to survive. However, despite all this trama, some were fortunate enough to get through it with the power of love.</p>
														<p>It might sound cliche, but time and time over love proves to be the saving grace of our characters in “A thousand Splendid Suns”. They learn that the only refuge from a harsh, uncompromising world is the love between individuals, which Laila was able to achieve due to Mariam’s self-sacrifice.</p>
														<p>Laila went on to have a great happy loving relationship with Tarik, represented through the 2 swans forming a heart when together. While Mariam was left alone without true love her whole life despite being married, which I accurately symbolized through the lone swan in blue (colour of sadness). Taking note of their placement is also important as the lone swan of Mariam is in the dark foreground while Laila and Tarik’s swans are in the colourful light.</p>

														<h6>The Shooting Stars:</h6>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">There are 8 shooting stars, 7 shooting stars represent the miscarriages Mariam experienced while with Rasheed, the 8th shooting star is symbolic for Nana. These shooting stars were deliberately illustrated in my creative media piece as each of these deaths has directly affected Mariam’s current life situation, they are a constant reminder that Mariam can not escape her own failure. This includes her failure to carry children, and her failure to save her Nana, which all had an impact on how her life unraveled and now are nothing but wishes, wishes that she could make a reality.</li>
																	<ul>
																		<li style="margin-left: 60px">"In the four years since the day at the bathhouse, there had been six more cycles of hopes raised then dashed, each loss each collapse, each trip to the doctor more curching for Mariam than the last" (Hosseini 99)</li>
																	</ul>
																</ul>
															</ul>
														</p>
														<h6>The Stars:</h6>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">Stars are symbolic of divinity with a belief being that the countless stars we see in the distance are fallen angels cast out from heaven. Which is why I have chosen to include them in my art piece to represent the thousands of splendid women in Kabul who all have to endure the horrible circumstances in the country due to the men with crooked views. These men in their lives control their environment, and these stars represent the thousands of women who have to live in an oppressed and abusive state due to these negative male figures within their lives just like Mariam and Laila experienced.</li>
																	<ul>
																		<li style="margin-left: 60px">"[A] reminder of how women like us suffer, hoe quietly we endure all that falls upon us." (Hosseini 91)</li>
																	</ul>
																</ul>
															</ul>
														</p>
														<h6>The Eagle:</h6>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">The eagle is a symbol of being released from bondage, being released from the captives that society holds women to. This eagle represents how Laila is her own free individual by the end of the novel and is able to fly freely and live life according to her will at last. The eagle is seen flying in the colourful background far from Rasheed to represent Laila finally being able to enjoy life without Rasheed.</li>
																	<ul>
																		<li style="margin-left: 60px">"It is a good life... a life to be thankful for. It is, in fact, precisely the sort of life she used to dream for herself in her darkest days with Rasheed." (Hosseini 388)</li>

														<p>The sunset in the background which lights up my art piece is symbolic of Mariam's will throughout the novel.</p>
														<p>The light she had as a child going to Jalil's house for the first time, the light she possessed waiting for Jalil every Thursday, the light she needed when believing in her relationship with Rasheed all shined bright at the beginning similar to the sunset. However, as she discovered the bitter truth of the world around her, her dad ashamed of her, her abusive husband, Mariam's light was no longer able to overcome the darkness of society, specifically the men around her, the sunset light burns out, and with it, Mariam.</p>

														<p>The Mountains in the background of my creative media illustration are representative of the seemingly insurmountable problems that Mariam faces as a woman in a male-dominated society. </p>
														<p>These mountains illustrate the very prominent theme of male dominance throughout the novel. Through Hossini’s own words we learn Mariam feels “a sensation of shrinking. This man’s will felt to Mariam as imposing and immovable as the Safid-Koh mountains looming over Gul Daman.” Mariam’s inner thoughts emphasize the authority that men have over women in Afghanistan with a simile comparing Rasheed’s “will” to “mountains”. This unmistakably demonstrates that Mariam feels it is futile to battle back against the male dominance in Afghanistan as this issue is such a large and insurmountable problem.</p>
														<p>Additionally, Hosseini references the mountains “looming” over” the town that Mariam is familiar with as she had grown up there, this is conveyed in my art piece as well, as the mountains in “Afterlife” are looming over the rest of her visualized life. Hosseini uses this reference to describe how men in Afgan culture have and will continue to keep on controlling women, similarly to mountains which will always be there, hence the mountains accurately symbolize Mariam’s insurmountable problems.

														<h6>Dead Tree:</h6>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">The dead tree amongst the lively forest on the left of the middle ground is symbolic of Nana, Mariam’s mother. Being one of the only few to wish well on Mariam and support her, she stood strong like a tree against all that was thrown at her with Mariam being the roots keeping her down. However the unfortunate leaving of Mariam left Nana without the roots that held her down thus far and led to her disheartening suicide. This is why I have created a dead tree amongst my art piece to represent Nana and her ultimate fate.</li>
																</ul>
															</ul>
														</p>
														<h6>The Lake (Colourful Among The Dark Foreground):</h6>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">My art piece is a depiction of Mariam’s afterlife heaven where she is able to take a look back at her life visually showcasing the bad and good. Now despite the strong presence of sad symbolism the lake represents one of the few moments Mariam was able to feel joy. As a young child, she would wait anxiously for Jalil to visit as, “Mariam and Jalil always went fishing in the stream. He showed her how to cast her line, how to reel in the trout… together they sang” (Hosseini 23). The lake was the one place she felt happiness and including that apart of her “Afterlife” showcases the depth of my illustration.</li>
																</ul>
															</ul>
														</p>
														<h6>Taliban & Afghanistan Flag:</h6>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<li style="margin-left: 40px">This flag standing tall on the mountains is a representation of the insurmountable problem that the Taliban taking Afghanistan over posed for Mariam. As the country was nearly taken over I was able to create a flag with 70% of it being the flag of the Taliban and only 30% being Afghanistan symbolizing how throughout the novel the Taliban were in control of the country and stood strong like the mountains.</li>
